# About the competition
DengAI is the data science online competition hosted by the DrivenData. The goal of this competition is to predict the number of Dengue case occurrences in two cities.
- San Juan, Puerto Rico. The largest and capital city of Puerto Rico, which is a country in the tropical equator zone, in which the number of Dengue cases have been rising since 1990.
- Iquitos, Peru. The largest city in the Amazon rainforest region of Peru. According to the data, the Dengue fever emerged in Iquitos at the beginning of the 21st century, and because the town is located in the humid forest area, there are high chances that the pandemic is going to be happened.

The data used in the competition are climate features, e.g. temperature, prepicitation, and humidity. Since the Dengue fever is spread by a bite of a mosquito. Factors affecting the propagation of mosquitoes are ones that potentially drive the widespread of this disease.
